INTRODUCTION
============

I beliebe that the worst that can happen is the situation in whic occur the conjuction of three conditions: that we are in a situatioan in which one does not have a retional justification. Our evaluations are based on idisyncratic preferences, and, one act as if following a norm or as if fulfilling an standard.

I agree that theoretical virtues, and in particular simplicity, play a role in in screening-off outlandish hypotheses. However, I believe that the way Brenner depicts it is not complete accurate. In particular, it can be shwon that simplicity is no suffiecient to screen-off outlandish theories. Since, the hypothesis's outlandishness does not impose many restrictions on the quality or merit of the hypothesis. That means that it is possible to conceive outlandish hypothesis that are simple, or, at least, simpler than the alternative. For instance, for any theory and contradictory evidence, one can hypothezise that the evidence is the result of a conicidence. Now, in invoking coincidences, we are not postulating anything that is not already implicit in scientific practice or theories. The existence of conicidences is assumed in common sense, scientific thoeries and sientific methodology. As a matter of fact, statistical tests rely on the existance of conicidences; such is the basis for the statistical concept of *sampling error* which is the the basis of many tests. Common statistical tests, such as ANOVA, are intended to quantify the probability that an observed data set is the result of sampling error. In other words, of naturally occrring variations, or on layman's terms: of coincidence.

To show that it is not sufficient consider the hypotheisi that the evidence is coincidence. The hypotheiss is outladish, however it sis a smpler hypothesisi than the alternative. Coincidences are already pat of any epistemological and methodologial pressupositions. In scinence or in daily life. for instance, in statistical analysis, hypethisis tested are conducted by analysing whther or not a the observed characteristics of a dataset can be explained as a result os *sampling error*. The concept of smapling error is nothing but a variation of a conincdence. therefore in postulating that there \#\#\#\#\# QUOTATION SUPEREROGATION STANFORD ENCYCLOPEDIA \[...\] recognition of the particular way in which the agent faced a moral challenge and acted as she did (e.g. overcoming special difficulties or obstacles, or sacrificing herself in the course of doing either what was her duty or what lay beyond it) \[...\]

NORMATIVITY IN GENERAL
----------------------

In general, oncewe understand better the evaluative practice, we are in better position to undestand and propose accordingly normativities. Thus, once we understand the structure of supererogative value, we realize that such value is grounded on the antecedent virtues, is similat to the antecedent virtues. We understand that value comes from going above and beyond the duties and prohibitions imposed by the antecedent virtues. Therefore, a reasonable way to interpret the normativity associated to such evaluative practice is to explicitly aknowledge that we ought to expect the fulfilment of duties and prohibitions and that on top of that we further achieve simplicity. Thus, a normativity that aknwoledges this, must ask to first fulfil our theory-duties and then go even further by asking for simplicity. In other words, simplicity is an aim beyond the aims prescribed by duty. It has value in as ford it goes beyon the standard aims.

### ADAGE PRESCRIPTION

Thus, instead of the adage Other things being equal, simple theories are better. Our interpretation of the normative import of simplicity would be somethig as: once duties and prohibitions have been fulfiled, theories that, beyond such duties, mangage to achieve simplicity are better.

OCCAM'S RAZOR
=============

#### NOTE ON STRATEGY USE COMPARISON BETEN THE VALUE OF A SIMPLE THEORY WHE IT FULFILS VIRTUES AN WHEN IT DOES NO.

The value does not stay the same. Rather, the value in the admonition: *All other things being equal, simple theries are better.* the problem with this statement is that in practice, the value of simplcity is one of the things that do not remain the same. The supererogation comparison shows that the value does not stay the same. Simplicty is valued different when the theory is virtous than when it fails to fulfil the virtues.

CONDITIONS OF WORST-CASE-SCENARIO
=================================

1.  No demarcation/discrimination.
2.  No correlation to internal or external factors (Sibley's concept independent).
3.  Finality or No justification.
4.  Ungroundedly normative.

TRUTH AND SIMPLICITY

\[...\] priors. We should also challenge Bueno's and Shalkowski's contention that scientists have learned that certain theories are true, or false, without taking into consideration their satisfaction of theoretical virtues. Start with their contention that scientists have learned that various theories, including Newtonian physics, are false. It seems to me that scientists have learned that these theories are false in part by relying on theoretical virtues. We can make any theory, such as Newtonian physics, accommodate new observations either by making ad hoc modifications to the theory, or by challenging the observations. Why didn't scientists do one of those two things when, say, they acquired new observations which seemed to falsify Newtonian physics? 20 For example, when Arthur Eddington reported astronomical observations incompatible with Newtonian physics, why didn't scientists conclude that, say, sneaky gremlins had tinkered with Eddington's instruments and made him seem to see or measure things which weren't really there (just as sneaky gremlins were sometimes claimed (seriously or not) to tinker with airplanes during World War II)? Arguably, the reason scientists didn't do that is because they made tacit appeal to theoretical virtues---for example, the gremlin hypothesis should be rejected because it is wildly complex. Equivalently: Newtonian physics, modified so as to include the scheming gremlins, is a wildly complex theory. It requires that we postulate a new class of beings who we otherwise have no reason to posit, with specific desires and abilities (e.g., the desire and ability to tamper with scientific instruments). Perhaps the gremlin hypothesis fares poorly with respect to its satisfaction of other theoretical virtues as well. Even so, its gratuitous complexity seems to be a large part of the reason it was and is not taken seriously. Why bring gremlins into the discussion? Why not just stick to real examples from the history of science? My response is that the fact that nobody proposed the gremlin hypothesis is itself an instructive fact regarding the real history of science. And it nicely brings out the point I want to make: that we sometimes reject theories because they are gratuitously complex, and we do this so automatically and without conscious deliberation that we often fail to realize we are doing so. The point would not be so well illustrated by some hypothesis which people did seriously consider---after all, 20 Well, some scientists did make ad hoc modifications to Ne \[...\]

### FILTER

In addition to theory choice, simplicity is use in a variety of sientific contexts. In this section, we will explore a context which resembles the worts-case-scenario described above and will show how the supererogation model can help to improve our understhading of it. Instances similar to our worst-case scenario occur in some cases of falsification and in proposing explanatory hypothesis.

#### CONJUNCTION VS. HIERARCHICAL EMBED

I believe that the best way to model the use of simplicity's value is not as the estamationas associated to such value entering in a conjuction with other estimtions. As in, for example:

*P(s ^ tv)*

But rather as a hierarchical strcture in wich the associated estimation is embeded in a different level of evaluation

*P(tv(s,t))*

Scientific theories and hypotthesis are filtered before being tested. Outlandish thoeries, for example, are never even considered as candidates for testing. The fact that we conduct this pre-evaluative screening-off is important in, for example, Baysian approaches to theory evaluation. In Bayes' Theorem, the initial likelihood of an hypothesis before any evidence is encountered is estimated and assign. This is what is call the Prior probability. This probability assignement occurs in absence of any evidence or inforation abour its truth or eprirical adequacy, thus, it is only non-empirical considerations tha are taking into account. Siplicity is one of the most important considerations in Prior estimation. This has sometimed interpreted as an argument that such estimations capture a putaive connection beteern simplicity and truth. Since simple theories are assignem hisher problablilities, this can be naturally interpreted as sipler theories being regarded as more lilely to be true.

One case in which we have near-wors-scenario circumstances is in the screening-off of outlandish theories. This kind of situations, in science or daily life, occur when an observation can not be explanined by the extant theories, and it is necesary to introduce an hypothesis to account for it. the issue in which we are interested is the fact that outlandish hypothesis are not even considered as possible explanations. I call this fact the screening-off of outlandish hypothesis.

In this section, I apply the superergation model to explore one possible interpretation of the relation of simplicity to truth or, more generally, the accepted theoretical virtues. We established that in the worst-case-scenario, the value of simplicity is characterized as being final and having no rational justification. This characteristics are instantiated in the case of the use of simplicity in the Bayesian arguments. Let us elaborate the problem. Consider the context in the initial stage of proposing a theory. This is not the context of theory choice nor evalation. Therefore, epirical and truth considerations are not in place. And not all theoretical virtues can be considered either, since the theory is just being proposed, pending any kind of evaluation. In this situation, outlandish theories such as the intervention of extraterrestrial or of evil deamons, are not even considered. Nonetheless, such outlandish theories can have explanatory power. One of the explanations proposed to accout for the fact that outlandish theories are not eve proposed or seriously considered, is that sensible theories, the theories that are in fact proposed, are simpler than outlandish theories.

As we mentioned, not all theoretical virtues are abailable, due to the fact the \#\# Bayesian Argument \#\# Simplicity screens off crazy thwories \#\# No principled argument connecting trun in the prioors \#\# Superreerogation explain such value. Using non rational explanation and non-normativity. I believe that \[\[Brennere\]\] is basically correct. However, that i no the whole story. The first problem is that simplicity is no sufficient. We can have outlandish theories that are simpler that the sensible theories. As a matter of fact, due to the fact that oulandishnes has no limitations, that is why it is oulandish, this surely gives it the freedom that makes it easier to find simpler hypothetis, than the ones we would find being limited by the strictures of sisibleness. So you can have simper outlandish theories. The second problem is that it it use in screening-off is not really an argumet for the truth-conducivity of simplity, since the screeening off oulandishness does not warrant truth. We can have sensible true as well as false theries. And, conversely, we can also have oulandish true and false. Thoeries.

#### ENTER THE SUPEREROGATION-MODEL

#### WHAT IS WRONG WITH BRENNER'S ACCOUNT

The outlandish hypothesis can be varied indfinitely. Sice they are easy, they have no merit. Thus there is no value in going above and beyond, since the resulting thing has no value. Therefore it easy to come by with an outlandish explanation that is, at least, simpler, than the alternative sensible explanations. Therefore simplicity is not suffiencient to screen-off outlandish hypothesis. \#\#\#\# MY EXPLANATION OF FALSIFICATION we demand that the hypothesis itself be in compliance of the teorietical-virtues duties. and also that offers simplicity above and beyond that. Outlandish hypothesis are quite easy to come by. Outlandish hyothesis that go beyond the virtue-theoritical duty are much more scarce. And in this circustances the hypothesis the fulfil its duties and goes abobe and beyond that is simple the alternative theory. or in this conditions the simplest hypotheris is the alternative hypotherisi. In our case the General Theory of Relativity.

### lesson

One of the lesson from the non-suffieciency of simplicity to screen-off is that, due to the non-demandedness of outlandishness and the demandedness of sesibleness. This translates in th fact that it is less of an an achivement to find simplicity in outlandish thoeoris than in sensible theories.

Thus S 1. Simplicity is not an apistemic or pragmatic virtue. !. There set of theetical virtues is very rediced, since in the initial context of screeening there are no virtues such as truth or empirical adequacy. With these reduced set, simplicity aqctures a premium value. This value is no epistemic or pragmatic. Also the usual value as an ain of scienci as a virtue with final value, cannot explain why there is a premium.

The premium can be explaned by the supererogation model. After the thoery is founc to comply with the redued set of virtues, we appreciate the on top of that the thery manage to do it in a simple manner. This value results from appteciation the the simplicty goes abobe and beyond fullfilling the duty of complying with the reduded set of virtues. If we evaluated the simplicity of the thoery without any considerations to whether the theory comply with the virtues, the value we attribute to such simplicty will be different to the value we attrigte to complying and further being simple. This difference in the value we attribute is explained by the fact that in the last case the value is a supererogtory value.

circularity

brenner metaph method analogy

privileged stance

For example, consider the case in which the theory is propsed to explain certain observations. For instance, the presence of certain traits in a biological species. In this situation, scientists propose different explanations: convergent evolution, or the outlandish theory of extraterrestrial interventio. However, this last outlandish theory is never seriously considered. Now, the outlandish theory and the sensible theories share the virtues of explanatory power. Since, the are being proposed because the can explain the problematic observations. \[\[Brenner, 9999\]\] draws attention to the fact that, given that outlandish and sensible theories share the virtue of explanatory power, the reason why sensible theories are preferred is their simmplicity respecto to outlandish theories. I believe that \[\[Brenner\]\] suggestion is pin points something impotant. But the reason why we prefer simple thoeries is becuse they seem to add value simplicity seems to add value, and not necessarily for the intrinsic value of simplicity. This process of added value, can be accounted by the supererpgation model.

To see this consider a situation analogous to the aesthetic case. Assume first thawe do not know about empirical adecuacy , truth, explanatory poert and other virtuues of the theories. By we can appreciate that it is simple. Now, if now in addition to the simplicty we learn that the theory in fact satisfy the other theoretical virtues, the value that we attrivute to its simplicity is different than tha value when no other virtues are fullfilled.

Now, \[\[brenner\]\] argues that the fact that simplicty account for the screening of outlandish theories can be interpreted as an argument for believing that simplicty is truth conducive. This argument is similar to the Baysian argument that simplicity makes more probale a hypothesis, as reflected in the attribition of higher values to the priors of sensible theories. I believe that the supererogation model cn offer an alternative account. A more simple account. Simplicity is not necessary truth condicive or probability enhancing, but rather the connection between truth and simplctity is that the value of simplicty is connected via supererogation. The value depends and is conditioned to the fullfilment of the other virtues, icluding truth. The value of simplicty is conditinal on whether the theory is truth.

It is a dependency relation that goes the fulfilment of virtues to the change in value of simplicity.

### MERIT FUNCTION

#### OR MERIT ERROR

The merit function can be expressed in bayesian terms. but more iprtantly, The point that I am making here is that there are independent factors (independet from empirical or prudential concenrns) that modulate the merit functions. Aesthetic appreciation, as we have discussed, can be one of them , and perhaps the most representative of the worst-case-scenarrio. However, the merit function can have a role in near worst-case-scenarios. My proposal is precisely that the eay in which value is acquired are not limited to the traitional duties and prohibitions. Bayesian approches just stay within the border of estimating truth likelihoods within the context of a limited rules of probability ins a sample space. The supererogation approach says that value can come from other sources. Supererogations being one of such sources.

Dependency
----------

the key is dependency in intrumentalist discussion. The value is dependent on the set of virtues, on the way those vitues harmonize or relate with eac other and on how easilyor how cumbersoly the theory manage to fulfil the set of virtues vitues.

The supererogation model can be used to propose an anternative account of the connection between truth and simplicity: connection is the value resulting from going above and beyond truth. This value is used to attribute connections to truth or to estimate probabilities in bayesian contexts. It must be pointed out that, as in the worst-case-scenario, this value is impacted by the fullfilment of the set of virtues. Thus, the supererogated value is conditional on the truth of the theory, or on other theoretical virtues. Therefore, the connection is more complicated, the connection goes from fullfilment conditioning the value of simpictiy and this value used to estimate its connection to truth. It is a complex chain of connections, and in some cases with circular chaining, since thruth conditions simplicity' value and the value used to estimate truth. However, I believe that this way of depicting simplicity's connection to truth is an accurate depiction of what actually occurs when scientis use simplicity as a criterion for theory screeening. Also, I believe, althogh there are some circularities in the connection, such circularities are not really problematic. This depiction is consistent with the bayesiona and \[\[Brenner\]\] proposal and represents a way to explicate what is occurring in the process of attibuting conections of conducivity or attributing probabilities to priors in Bayesina contexts.

The details of this proces of interaction between simplicity's value, virtues and attribution of conducivness/probability deserves a more detailed investigation, but for the sake of brevity I will not conduct it here.

### NOTE ON WHAT I AM DOING

note: we are talking about where does it come from the practice or what grounds the practice or an analysis of what is going on. This however isnot a justification, a rational reconstruction would be a more appropriate label.

Amrubmny:
---------

The difference between outlandish and sensible hypothesis is not just their simplcity, since we can have outlandish simpler than sensible, for instance, postulatin one demon vs. postulating two kinds of charge, Hhr way in which the simplicit is achieved, that is grounded on a reduced set of virtues. \#\#\# if If simplicity were sufficient, then simplicity would have a pragmatic value: being instrumental in getting rid of outlandish theories.

#### objection

if simplicity in screening-off were use because it is truth conducive, then then sensible theories should be considered as more truth-connected. However, sensible thoeries can be true as much as false. Sensibleness, is no inherentrly conected to truth. In the same way, outlandish theories can be true of false, there is no special conection to falsity. It does not solve the problem but it help to understnad why simplicity is actually actactive. In addition, it offers a grounded normativity, that can help us to offer more cautioious guide-lines to deal with such cases.

### se-model account for the details behind the actual use of simplicity and its attributions of conduciveness

### the simplicty's value resulting from se-model, as in the w-c-s, is linked to the grounding virtues, and therefore is a value consritute by such virtues.

### ONLY DIFFERENCE IS SIMPLICITY, VIRTUES IN THE BACKGROUS ARE ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME.

The assumptioins is that the background, for example all theories possess explanantory power. The only difference between outlandish and sensible hypothesis is simplcity. But this cannot be the whole story, since we can envisage outlandish and simple theories.

### COUNTER-INTUITIVE RESULTS FROM SIMPLICITY AS AN AIM

From assuming simplicity as an aim, it follows that it is rational to pursue dead-end theories. This fact is historically documented \[\[examples\]\] . The difference is that the se-model can offer a different kid of normativity. A normativite predicated on the condition of fulfilment the gounding set of virtues. The normativity in the cse of simplicity being an aim, is problematic, as it is unjustified and strong.

### ARGUMENT FOR TRUTH VS. ELUCIDATIOIN

in renner discussion of screening-off outlandis thories; simplicity appears as an argument for assuming a thoery truth. My project consist in eludicdation the value proces that ground the usage of simplicity. Thus an elucidation of the relation of simplicity to truth.

is going above and beyond being explanatory, by being explanatory in a simple manner.

INTRUMENTALIST VIEW
===================

### ALTERNATIVE TO TRADE-OFF, IN THE AGAINS-INSTRUMENTALISM-DISCUSSION.

In the agains-instumental view of simplicity, the weak poit is the assumption that, in mean-ends reasoning, the ony relation between menas and ends is trade-off. The supererogation mdel offers and alternative. Miean can give more value to ends cia the value of going above and beyond the the aims. Thus, in the case of a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. It can occur that scientis attribute more value to simplicty becuase the theory possesses instrumental value that goes above and beyond the slighty lesser accuracy of the theory. This also has the advantage of providing a grounded-normativity, as characterized in the previous section. That is a normativity that depends on the fulfilment of the gorunding set of virtues. Such grounded normativity, in turn, recommends the purse of simplcity only after achieving the grounding virtues. In this way the empty-pursuets problem is avoided, or, at least, mitigated.
